      <p>
        This book is a gentle introduction to FOAM programming. The book
        assumes that you have some experience programming in
        Javascript. Experience with object-oriented languages such as Java or
        C++ is helpful, but not necessary. Whenever possible, the book
        teaching FOAM programming through interactive examples. So, let's get
        to it.

        <title>First Steps</title>
        <p>
          Take a look at <b>Your First FOAM Class</b>. Start by just
          skimming over the whole class. You'll notice that the structure and
          meaning of the class is quite intuitive. The class has
          a <code>name</code>; it lives in a <code>package</code> (i.e., a
          namespace); it has several <code>properties</code>, each with
          a <code>name</code> and some other information.
        </p>
        <p>
          From a technical perspective, here the key things to note:
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>Classes are declared by invoking the <glossary-term>
            <term>CLASS()</term>
            <definition>
              The global function used for registering a new FOAM class. The
              function gets passed a class model, i.e., a Javascript object
              that describes the class.
            </definition>
          </glossary-term> function,
            and passing it an object that describes the class model.</li>
          <li>Every class must have a <code>name</code>, and optionally
            (though strongly encouraged), a <code>package</code>.</li>
          <li>After that, classes have a variety of collections, modelled
            using Javascript arrays.</li>
        </ul>

        </aside>

        <p>
          For this simple example, the only collection on the model
          is <code>properties</code>. It's worth noting that, by convention,
          this class would live in the
          file <code>js/foam/sandbox/Person.js</code>; classes modelled in
          Javascript live in <code>js/</code>, and files are stored according
          to their <code>package</code> and <code>name</code>.
        </p>
        <p>
          Let's take a look at the properties. That <glossary-term>
            <term>model_</term>
            <definition>
              This is the object key to attach to a model definition to
              describe the class of FOAM object to build. This can be a
              string containing a package + model name, or a
              FOAM <code>Model</code> object.
            </definition>
          </glossary-term> annotation might be the first thing that looks a
          bit strange. It's kind of like a type annotation, but
          different. The <glossary-term><term>model_</term></glossary-term> key denotes the model to use for
          construcing the current object. In this case, that object is a
          property, so <code><glossary-term><term>model_</term></glossary-term>: 'StringProperty'</code> denotes the type
          of property, not the type of data stored in the property (hence
          the <code>Property</code> postfix). The rest of the property
          annotations are as follows:
        </p>

          <ul>
            <li><glossary-term>
            <term>name</term>
            <definition>
              The object key for the in-code name of a modelled object.
            </definition>
          </glossary-term>: The name of the property in code; e.g., in
              a <code>Person</code> method, we may refer
              to <code>this.firstName</code>.</li>
            <li><glossary-term>
            <term>label</term>
            <definition>
              The object key for the user-facing name (i.e., text label) of a modelled object.
            </definition>
          </glossary-term>: The text label to use when creating a
              view of the property in the application's UI.</li>
            <li><glossary-term>
            <term>defaultValue</term>
            <definition>
              The object key for the default value of a modelled object
              (usually a property). Note that default values are shared by
              all instances of an object. As such, most default values that
              are not of a primitive type should be declared
              using <code>factory</code>,
              and <b>not</b> <code>defaultValue</code>. Both <code>defaultValue</code>
              and <code>defaultValueFn</code> do not emit property change
              events.
            </definition>
          </glossary-term>: The value to use when no value is
              provided.</li>
            <li><glossary-term>
            <term>factory</term>
            <definition>
              The object key for the default factory a modelled object
              (usually a property). Note that the factory is only invoked if
              no value is injected at creation time. Factories should return
              the intended value for the object/property. Also note that
              factories trigger property change events,
              whereas <code>defaultValue</code>
              and <code>defaultValueFn</code> do not.
            </definition>
          </glossary-term>: Like <code>defaultValue</code>, except
              the provided function is run every time an instance is created
              with no value provided.</li>
            <li><glossary-term>
            <term>getter</term>
            <definition>
              The object key for the getter for a modelled object (usually a
              property). When the object is looked up, the getter will be
              invoked and its return value will be delivered to the code
              looking for the object.
            </definition>
          </glossary-term>: A function to run when retrieving the
              property value; similar to Java
              convention <code>getSomeProperty()</code>, or
              the <code>get</code> key used in
              Javascript's <code>Object.defineProperty()</code>.</li>
          </ul>

        <p>
          This example illustrates several powerful features of FOAM. FOAM
          encourages a declarative style of modelling applications as
          data. No need for manually coding up getters and setters that
          procedurally inject defaults, UI labels, or other values <i>for
          every member variable</i>. You provide a concise description via
          the class model and the framework wires everything up for
          you. Notice that the <code>dateOfBirth</code> factory returns
          a <code>String</code>. However, it's a <code>DateProperty</code>,
          so is automatically adapted into a Javascript <code>Date</code>
          object for easy use in our <code>age</code> getter.
        </p>
        <section enumerate="false">
          <title>Try It Out</title>
          <p>
            Let's try making some changes to Your First FOAM Class.. First
            we'll add support for middle names. Add a property
            named <code>middleNames</code> with <code><glossary-term><term>model_</term></glossary-term>:
            'StringArrayProperty'</code>; give it a factory that returns the
            empty array, a label of <code>'Middle Name'</code> and annotate
            it with <code><glossary-term>
                <term>plural</term>
                <definition>
                  The object key for the plural form of a user-facing name
                  (i.e., text label) of a modelled object.
                </definition>
              </glossary-term>: 'Middle Names'</code>. Don't forget to drop
            the <code>(s)</code> in the <code>firstName</code> label to keep
            things consistent.
          </p>
          <p>
            Now let's make the class behaviour a little more efficient. Right
            now, the <code>age</code> getter recomputes the age every
            time. That's silly. The age really only needs to be recomputed
            when we set the date of birth. This can be achieved using FOAM's
            support for reactive programming. Cut the <code>age</code> getter
            to the clipboard. (You may want to paste it somewhere else in
            case you do more cutting or copying along the way.). Now, on
            the <code>dateOfBirth</code> property, add <code><glossary-term>
                <term>postSet</term>
                <definition>
                  The object key for a function to run after the value of a
                  modelled object (usually a property) is set. The function
                  is passed two parameters: the old and new values.
                </definition>
              </glossary-term>: function(old, nu) { this.age = this.computeAge(); }</code>. This
            callback will fire every time <code>dateOfBirth</code>
            changes, <i>after</i> the change has taken place. The callback is
            be passed the old and nu (or
            "<code>nu</code>") <code>dateOfBirth</code> values.
          </p>
          <p>
            Before we can declare our efficient age calculating code
            complete, we need a <code>computeAge</code> method. Beneath
            the <code>properties</code> array, add a <code>methods</code>
            array with one element
            with <code><glossary-term><term>name</term></glossary-term>: 'computeAge'</code>. Finally, add a <code>code</code>
            annotation to your one-and-only method and paste the function for
            the old <code>age</code> getter. That's it! Now, if we ever have
            code that repeatedly accesses that <code>age</code> property, we
            won't be slowed down by redundant computations.

          <p>
            So we have this <code>Person</code> class. What can we do with
            it? To start, let's just try instantiating one and printing one
            to the console. Take a look at <b>Working with the Person
            Class</b>. Notice that FOAM has decorated <code>console</code>
            with a JSON-logging object. <glossary-term>
              <term>console.log.json</term>
              <definition>
                The pretty-printed JSON <code>Sink</code>
              </definition>
            </glossary-term> behaves as a <glossary-term>
              <term>Sink</term>
              <definition>
                An interface for receiving events related to
                a <code>DAO</code>. Sinks are notified of new objects coming
                into the <code>DAO</code> via their <code>put(obj)</code>
                method; similarly notification of object removal occurs via
                the <code>remove(obj)</code> method. Sinks are also notified
                that a sequence of puts is complete via
                the <code>eof()</code> method, and notified of errors via
                the <code>error(err)</code> method. Note that Sinks recieve a
                copy of the object from the DAO; modifying the object passed
                to the <code>put(obj)</code> or <code>remove(obj)</code> Sink
                methods will not affect the collection stored in the DAO.
              </definition>
            </glossary-term>. A <glossary-term><term>Sink</term></glossary-term>
            is anything that receives events from a data storage collection
            in FOAM. In this case, the collection is messages written to the
            console. Notice that JSON output to the console is missing
            several properties (e.g., <code>firstName</code>
            and <code>lastName</code>). This is because the class stores the
            default values for these fields, and the current values match the
            defaults. This optimization is useful to, for example, save
            bandwidth when sending a large number of FOAM objects over the
            network; chances are, many of the objects will contain at
            least <i>some</i> values that match the defaults.
          </p>
          <p>
            We pass in the return value
            from <code>X.foam.sandbox.Person.create()</code>.
            <glossary-term>
              <term>X</term>
              <definition>
                A FOAM conteXt object. Contexts form a tree of prototypes or
                sub-contexts. As a result, values from parent contexts appear
                in the child context, and overwritten values in child
                contexts do not affect parent contexts. Contexts are intended
                to avoid polluting the Javascript global namespace and
                facilitate passing values between related components that do
                not have immediate references to each other. The
                unqualified <code>X</code> is the global context,
                whereas <code>this.X</code> within a FOAM method (or similar)
                refers to the modelled object's context. FOAM views
                automatically construct a sub-context for each of their child
                views. Other sub-contexts must be constructed manually
                using <code>X.sub()</code>.

            objects are used to encapsulate shared state without polluting

                The <code>create()</code> method attached to a FOAM class is
                the class instance constructor function. This method is
                optionally passed an object containing key/value pairs that
                describe initial property values for the object.
              </definition>
            </glossary-term> method to instantiate a new <code>Person</code>
            object. Note that FOAM classes are <b>not</b> constructor
            functions for use with the <code>new</code> keyword. All FOAM
            object instances are constructed by
            invoking <glossary-term><term>create()</term></glossary-term>. The
            create method can be passed an object containing values for
            object properties. Try passing an object literal
            to <glossary-term><term>create()</term></glossary-term> in the
            <b>Javascript</b> example code; you can set any of the properties
            listed in the <b>Person Class</b> code snippet.
          </p>
          <p>
            The HTML portion of this example renders a view of a person. FOAM
            has a whole suite of views. The default view of a FOAM object is
            a <code>foam.ui.DetailView</code>, which renders labels and
            values for each property. FOAM also supports specifying property
            values as <code>foam-tag</code> attributes, or as tags inside
            the <code>foam-tag</code>. Try replacing the <b>HTML</b> code
            with this:
          </p>

            <blockquote>
              <pre>&lt;foam-tag model="foam.sandbox.Person"&gt;
  &lt;firstName&gt;James&lt;/firstName&gt;
  &lt;lastName&gt;Dean&lt;/lastName&gt;
&lt;/foam-tag&gt;</pre></blockquote>

          <p>
            Run the code again and you'll see that the view has changed to
            show you James Dean. FOAM views support two-way data binding, so
            if you render a view of a FOAM object, the view and the object
            will stay in sync.

          <title>DAOs, Events, and Reactive Programming</title>
          <p>
            Have you worked on a Javascript project where you needed to fetch
            data over the wire from multiple sources, then wire up a bunch of
            callbacks to deal with data arriving, network and data extraction
            errors, and view updates? Then you want to try adding offline
            support and you have to shim in a mess of <code>IndexedDB</code>
            callbacks between your network code and your views. What a mess.
          </p>
          <p>
            FOAM provides several tools for dealing with common application
            development issues like these. One of the more powerful tools is
            a unified interface for data collections. We call this interface
            a <glossary-term>
              <term>DAO</term>
              <definition>
                Short for Data Access Object. This is FOAM's unified data
                collection interface. The <code>DAO</code> interface extends
                the <code>Sink</code> interface. In addition
                to <code>put(obj)</code>, <code>remove(obj)</code>, <code>eof()</code>,
                and <code>error(err)</code>, DAOs
                support <code>find(id)</code> for locating an object by ID,
                and <code>select(sink, options)</code> for processing
                queries, and <code>removeAll()</code> for emptying the
                collection. Of course, in the case of a
                DAO, <code>put(obj)</code> and <code>remove(obj)</code> are
                treated as commands to modify the underlying collection,
                whereas for a Sink, these methods serve as notifications of
                events occurring on the underlying DAO. Most DAOs also
                implement convenience functions for attaching query options
                such
                as <code>skip(num)</code>, <code>limit(num)</code>, <code>orderBy(expr)</code>,
                and <code>groupBy(expr)</code>.
              </definition>
            </glossary-term>, or Data Access Object. DAOs provide a simple
            interface for reading from collections
            (<code>find(id)</code>, <code>select(sink, options)</code>) and
            writing to collections
            (<code>put(obj)</code>, <code>remove(obj)</code>, <code>removeAll()</code>). What's
            more, FOAM provides DAO implementations for a wide variety of
            data storage modes, including an indexed in-memory store for
            caching (<code>MDAO</code>), IndexedDB for client-side
            persistence (<code>foam.dao.IDBDAO</code>), REST for network
            requests (<code>foam.core.dao.RestDAO</code>), and MongoDB for
            server code (<code>MongoDAO</code>). Since DAOs are often chained
            together in common patterns, FOAM also provides a high-level DAO
            setup interface called <code>EasyDAO</code>.

      <section>
        <title>What is FOAM?</title>
        <p>
          FOAM is a Javascipt framework for rapid application development. FOAM
          emphasizes detailed class specification, reactive programming, and
          modular design. If you're unfamiliar with any of these concepts,
          don't worry. There will be lots of chances for learning-by-doing as
          we go along.

      <section>
        <title>What FOAM Isn't</title>
        <p>
          <b>FOAM is not a language.</b> FOAM, the framework, and FOAM
          applications are written in Javascript. No extension required
          (ECMAScript 6, or otherwise).
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>FOAM is not a transpiler.</b> FOAM does support some simple
          templating for HTML and CSS, but these templates very lightweight;
          their syntax is straightforward and they are translated by the
          framework to HTML/CSS/Javascript lightning fast.

        FOAM is a meta-programming framework, implemented in Javascript, for
        modelling applications and their components at a high level. This
        facilitates rapid development and deployment across various languages
        and platforms. FOAM is a framework, not a language, compiler, or
        transpiler.
      </aside>
      <p>
        If you've spent time poking around in the FOAM codebase, you might
        think that there's more to this FOAM thing than
        yet-another-Javascript-framework. You'd be right. This section
        contains some truths about FOAM that are difficult to introduce
        before you're familiar with the basics of the framework.

        <title>What is FOAM, <i>Really</i>?</title>
        <p>
          "FOAM" is, in fact, an acronym. FOAM stands for Feature-Oriented
          Active Modeller. FOAM is a meta-programming framework for rapid
          software development. FOAM is implemented in Javascript, but the
          framework is language agnostic (more on that in the next
          section). For now, let's spell it out.
        </p>
        <p class="first-cap">
          F is for <i>feature</i>. In FOAM, a
          <glossary-term>
            <term>Feature</term>
            <definition>
              Features are units of data and behaviour, made as small as
              possible, to facilitate reuse through composition of many
              features.
            </definition>
          </glossary-term> is a fine-grained unit of encapsulation for data
          and behaviours. Behaviours are really a special sort of data in
          FOAM, but let's not get ahead of ourselves. Features should be as
          small as possible to facilitate flexible composition of features
          into <glossary-term>
            <term>Models</term>
            <definition>
              Models are essentially collections of
              <glossary-term><term>features</term></glossary-term>. FOAM's
              core model builder supports a variety of standard features,
              such as
              <glossary-term><term>properties</term></glossary-term>,
              <glossary-term><term>methods</term></glossary-term>,
              <glossary-term><term>actions</term></glossary-term>
              (user-initiated methods),
              <glossary-term><term>listeners</term></glossary-term>
              (pre-bound methods),
              <glossary-term><term>templates</term></glossary-term> (HTML,
              CSS, and others),
              <glossary-term><term>packages</term></glossary-term> (with
              dependency injection).
            </definition>
          </glossary-term>.
        </p>
        <p class="first-cap">
          O is for <i>oriented</i> (as in <i>feature-oriented</i>). Not
          featureful (bloated with features). Not feature-driven
          (everything's a feature). Feature-oriented. This means that FOAM is
          strongly encourages encapsulating things into simple features that
          can be composed to give rise to complex things. Truth be told, FOAM
          is model-driven, but that's jumping ahead again.
        </p>
        <aside>
          In addition to being <i>active</i>, FOAM is
          also <i>reactive</i>. Many of the tools in the FOAM toolbox
          encourage reactive programming. This allows developers to define
          their application in terms of responding to data changes or events
          when it is natural to do so.
        </aside>
        <p class="first-cap">
          A is for <i>active</i>. To understand what this means, we need to
          understand FOAM's perspective on data and behaviours. By data we
          mean represented information (constants, variables, numbers,
          strings, and the like). By behavoiurs we mean something that's
          runnable (code, functions, procedures, methods, and so on). FOAM
          deliberately blurs the line between the two. After all, behaviours
          need to be represented; so behaviours are simply data represented
          for a special purpose: computationally manipulating other data. In
          FOAM, there is virtually no distinction between the two. Code is
          simply data that can manipulate other data. In this sense, FOAM
          code changes itself. For example, all FOAM classes --
          called <glossary-term><term>Models</term></glossary-term> -- are
          actually data objects that can be modified and extended at run
          time.
        </p>
        <p class="first-cap">
          M is for <i>modeller</i>. As mentioned above, FOAM objects are
          instances of FOAM
          <glossary-term><term>Models</term></glossary-term>, which are
          composed of features.
          <glossary-term><term>Models</term></glossary-term> are the basic
          building block for developing FOAM applications, hence the FOAM
          framework is a toolset for <i>modelling</i> applications. It's
          worth noting that FOAM makes heavy use of the <i>MVC pattern</i> to
          structure an environment for modelling applications. We have found
          this approach to be a flexible and concise means for expressing
          common patterns that arise in developing applications. If you are
          unfamiliar with MVC, we encourage you to learn the basics before
          reading this book. Not only is much of FOAM itself written using
          MVC, but the toolset encourages developers to adopt this approach
          when appropriate.
        </p>
        <p>
          Make sense? Some of these terms are probably unfamiliar, so let's
          recap. FOAM is a modelling framework for expressing <i>concepts</i>
          at a high level. These <i>concepts</i> are realized by constructing
          FOAM
          <glossary-term><term>Models</term></glossary-term>, which resemble
          classes in languages like Java and C++. FOAM encourages
          expressing <i>concepts</i> through small
          <glossary-term><term>Features</term></glossary-term> that can be
          combined to give rise to a
          <glossary-term><term>Model</term></glossary-term> of
          the <i>concept</i> you have in mind.
        </p>
        <p>
          When you start building something with FOAM, remember this:
        </p>

        <title>What FOAM Isn't, <i>Really</i></title>
        <p>
          <b>FOAM is not a language. Really.</b> FOAM's meta-programming
          features allow it to interact with various languages and
          environments, but that still doesn't make FOAM a language unto
          itself. FOAM code is written in Javascript.
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>FOAM is not a transpiler. Really.</b> FOAM classes are modelled
          at a higher level than the language-level. This allows FOAM to
          generate code in various languages, but <i>that is not what a
          transpiler does</i>. A transpiler directly and completely simulates
          all the features of one language in some other language. Many
          transpilers generate inefficient code not because they are poorly
          written, but because the source language and target language have
          radically different opinions on how code should be written. Hence,
          simulating one language in the other is slow. Modelling classes at
          a high level, <i>above</i> the language-level, allows FOAM to
          construct performant code in a variety of environments by being
          less opinionated about the implementation details than a typical
          programming language.
