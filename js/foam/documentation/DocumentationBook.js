            <FOAM is a modeling system to describe data and how it behaves, and
            from that generate entire apps. Data can be
            items from a database, $$DOC{ref:'foam.ui.View',usePlural:true} in a UI, or moves
            that a chess piece can make. If it's a thing that can be described with
            attributes and behaviors, it can be a $$DOC{ref:'Model'}.</p>
            <p>To share functionality between similar $$DOC{ref:'Model',usePlural:true}, you
            can inherit the features of another $$DOC{ref:'Model'} by
            $$DOC{ref:'Model.extendsModel',text:'extending'} it, or merge other
            $$DOC{ref:'Model',usePlural:true} in as $$DOC{ref:'Model.traits'}.</p>
            <p>$$DOC{ref:'Model',usePlural:true} are starting to sound a lot like
            object-oriented classes, and in fact when generating Java code FOAM will
            produce Java Classes from your Models. In Javascript you get a __proto__
            set on your instances, which is the equivalent of a class. $$DOC{ref:'Model',usePlural:true}
            are a superset of classes, however, and can do much more.</p>
            <p>The power of FOAM is how easily the pieces can be slotted together:
            <ul>
              <li>A generic two-pane controller can run an email app or a bug tracker without
              any changes: just swap out the Data Access Object ($$DOC{ref:'DAO'}) and the
              $$DOC{ref:'Model',usePlural:true} for the data items.</li>
              <li>Throw your $$DOC{ref:'DAO'} into a $$DOC{ref:'foam.ui.DAOListView'} and the
              user can browse the collection. Want a grid? Throw in a $$DOC{ref:'GridView'}
              instead. Not sure which? Let $$DOC{ref:'foam.ui.DetailView'} pick the view at run
              time.</li>
              <li>Need to communicate something to or from a child object, but don't
              want to be burdened with knowing what type it is or if it exists?
              $$DOC{ref:'Model.exports',text:'Export'} your value to your
              $$DOC{ref:'developerDocs.Context', text:'context'},
              and a reference gets propagated to objects you create.
              $$DOC{ref:'developerDocs.Events.chapters.binding',text:'Bind'}
              it to a property and you'll get value changes automatically propagated.</li>
              <li>Need to cache data from your back end? Throw a $$DOC{ref:'foam.dao.CachingDAO'}
              on top of your $$DOC{ref:'RestDAO'}. Want to swap the whole thing out at
              run time? Hide it behind a $$DOC{ref:'foam.dao.ProxyDAO'}
              and your app won't know the difference.  </li>
            </ul>

            Traditional object-oriented classes are useful abstractions that provide
            structure to code, keeping data and the code to manage it in one place.
            But how does one add meta-data to a class? Javadocs uses special comments
            hacked in with a special parser, outside of the core language. Runtime-accessible
            meta-data is limited or non-existent.
            </p>
            <p>With all this time spent creating ways to embed metadata into code, and still being
            stuck with the same old code, why not reverse the paradigm? FOAM puts metadata first,
            with the code (and even programming language) being subordinate.
            </p>
            <p>$$DOC{ref:'Model'} describes a set of features that
            each object in the system will have. Each feature, such as $$DOC{ref:'Model.properties'},
            $$DOC{ref:'Model.methods'}, or even $$DOC{ref:'Model.documentation'} is also
            described by a $$DOC{ref:'Model'} ($$DOC{ref:'Property'},
            $$DOC{ref:'Method'}, and $$DOC{ref:'Documentation'} respectively), and
            in fact the definition of $$DOC{ref:'Model'}
            itself is an instance of $$DOC{ref:'Model'}.</p>
            <p>For instance:
            <ul>
              <li>$$DOC{ref:'Property'} has a $$DOC{ref:'Property.name'} as one would expect,
              but also $$DOC{ref:'Property.hidden'} and $$DOC{ref:'Property.view'} properties
              to indicate how it should be displayed.</li>
              <li>$$DOC{ref:'Method'} has $$DOC{ref:'Method.code'} as one might expect, but also
              the list of $$DOC{ref:'Method.args',text:'arguments'},
              with further details available for each, describing everything needed to generate
              the method in different languages.</li>
              <li>There are also $$DOC{ref:'Action',usePlural:true}, $$DOC{ref:'Relationship',usePlural:true},
              and a slew of other features that $$DOC{ref:'Model'} provides to allow you
              to describe your data and the relations between them.</li>
            </ul>
            </p>
            <p>With all that meta-information available, many avenues open up:
            code generation, database persistence, serialization, data display and layout
            can all be automated, to the point where modeling your new data and plugging
            it into an old app creates a completely new experience for the user with little effort
            from the developer.</p>
            <p>Since each part of a $$DOC{ref:'Model'} is itself a $$DOC{ref:'Model'},
            $$DOC{ref:'Model'} definitions themselves are easy to store in a $$DOC{ref:'DAO'},
            pulling in features as they need them. This enables dynamic loading (if your
            chosen language supports it, like Javascript), or
            providing features and code to the client based on run-time decisions.
          */}
        },

          body: function() {/*
            You've defined a $$DOC{ref:'Model'} or two, but what happens then? You can pull
            a copy of your $$DOC{ref:'Model'} from the root context with <code>X['MyModelName']</code>
            or <code>X.MyModelName</code>, and create an instance of it with
            <code>X.MyModelName.create({args},X)</code>. But what kind of object did you pull?
            </p>

            <p>When you declare a $$DOC{ref:'Model'}, inheritance follows your
            $$DOC{ref:'Model.extendsModel'} property down through the chain until
            you omit $$DOC{ref:'Model.extendsModel'}.
            At each step, new $$DOC{ref:'Property',usePlural:true} or other features are
            added on, as one would expect from inheritance. When you examine the "MySub"
            object from your context, you see all the inherited features. Calling create()
            instantiates those features on an instance object, where you can assign values
            or call methods.</p>
            <p><img src='images/Model_runtime1.png'/></p>

            <p>But what are "MyBase" and "MySub" in the above diagram? In object-oriented
            languages they are typically special class definitions that exist outside
            the heap where instances live. In pure Javascript, they would be __proto__
            objects.</p>
            <p>In FOAM, those $$DOC{ref:'Model'} definitions are actually instances of
            $$DOC{ref:'Model'}, including $$DOC{ref:'Model'} itself:</p>
            <p><img src='images/Model_runtime2.png'/></p>

            <p>So your $$DOC{ref:'Model',usePlural:true} are instances of $$DOC{ref:'Model'}.
            Features are also
            instantiated inside your $$DOC{ref:'Model',usePlural:true}.
            The $$DOC{ref:'Property',usePlural:true}
            are shown in the diagram above. When building instances of your $$DOC{ref:'Model'}
            the lists of inherited $$DOC{ref:'Property',usePlural:true} and other features
            are merged to form the complete list of features your instance is built with.</p>

            <p>Note the red arrows on the left. $$DOC{ref:'Model'} creates itself, and the
            $$DOC{ref:'Property',usePlural:true} list is a $$DOC{ref:'Property'} listed in
            the $$DOC{ref:'Property',usePlural:true} list!
            How do they create themselves before they are defined? The answer is to cheat
            during the bootstrap process. Temporary placeholders are filled in to build up
            $$DOC{ref:'Model'} and its components, and replaced with the final versions
            at the end of the process.

              <li><code>remove</code>: called to remove an item into the Sink</li>

              <li><code>error</code>: called to indicate an error has terminated operations</li>
            </ul>
            <p>This means that you can generate a Sink as simply as:</p>
            <p><code>{ put: function(item) { console.log(item); } } // logs each item (useful for debugging)</code></p>
            <p>A DAO is a Sink with some extra querying methods:</p>
            <ul>
              <li><code>select</code>: dump the contents to the given Sink</li>
              <li><code>where</code>: return a DAO equivalent to the current one filtered by the given predicates</li>
              <li><code>listen</code>: continuously update the given sink with all future changes</li>
              <li><code>pipe</code>: select() then listen()</li>
            </ul>
            <p>All DAO operations are asynchronous. When requesting a <code>select</code>, it will
            return immediately but the Sink you have specified may not yet have been updated.</p>
            <p><code>
            var mySink = [].dao; // use an array as a DAO<br/>
            myDAO.select(mySink); // select into it<br/>
            // no guarantees mySink has anything yet!
            </code></p>
            <p>Since DAOs are asynchronous, you can't just ask for the number of items. To get
            a count of the number of items in a DAO, use the COUNT() Sink:</p>
            <p><code>myDAO.select(COUNT())(function(c) { console.log("my count is ", c); });</code></p>
