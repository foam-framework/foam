I had a question about how to implement a custom View which lets you increment a count stored in another DAO.  I've implemented the code to show how to do this and recorded a video walkthrough which explains it.

Of course you would want to add some CSS to fix up the appearance in the final version.  Also, you might want to add a timer to force the CountView to refresh at the start of every new day.
