Problem with JS Package Systems

They assume that requirements can be fulfilled synchronously, but
since most JS libraries are asynchronous, this greatly limits their
options for fulfilling dependency requests.

The solution to this problem is to use an asynchronous API for
requirements acquisition.  This allows for dependencies to be lazily
loaded from databases or from the network.  This essentially provides
the equivalent of Java's powerful "class loader" system.



Problem with Dependency-Injection

A composite object should be loosely coupled with its sub-components
so that they can be replaced (or decorated) without the knowledge (or
alteration) of the parent.  However, if a new sub-component has new
dependencies that were not explicit dependencies of the parent
component, then the parent component has no means of injecting the
unknown value.
  
The solution is to use store dependencies in hierarchical context
objects.  Contexts contain all available exported services and are
passed down from a component to its sub-components.  This allows a
sub-component to access dependencies from the Context which were not
dependencies of the parent.

Ex. Suppose that you have an AddressView with a 'state' field which
uses a 'TextFieldView'.  If some user of this Model wants to replace
the default sub-view with a StateView and that View has a dependency
on the StateDAO, then this would break dependency-injection because
the AddressView was not dependent on the StateDAO.  With Contexts, the
StateDAO dependency can flow through the AddressView without it being
aware or having to change its interface to accommodate the new and
improved StateView. 



Explicit Scopes

The Property Model will be extended to allow for properties to
explicitly state their 'scope'.  A scope indicates where the value for
that property is to be stored.  Most OO languages have two scopes:
instance and class/static variables.  There is also the 'global'
scope, but it is usually manipulated through a separate system.


Ex.

properties: [
  // A standard 'instance' variable
  {
    name: 'instanceVar',
    scope: 'instance_'    // Default, not needed
  },

  // A standard 'static' / 'class' variable
  {
    name: 'staticVar',
    scope: 'static_'
  },

  // A dependency inherited from a parent Object
  {
    name: 'parent'
  },
  {
    name: 'fromParent',
    scope: 'parent'
  },

  // A facade for a property actually stored in a child component
  {
    name: 'child'
    valueFactory: function() { return Child.create(); }
  },
  { 
    name: 'fromChild',
    scope: 'child'
  },

  // A property taken from the supplied Context.
  { 
    name: 'fromContext',
    scope: 'context_'
  }
]

Standard Scopes
  * instance_: corresponds to 'instance' variables
  * static_: corresponds to 'static' or 'class' variables
  * default_: corresponds to default-values, if specified in the model

No Globals

The use of global variables inhibits re-usability and
re-composability.  Once you use a global, you restrict yourself to
only having a single instance of that item and whatever else depends
on it.

The software industry has long hoped to establish a level of software
re-use through componentization, much like the electronics and other
industries. Unfortunately software components haven't succeeded as
expected. The reason for this failure is the simple static or global
variable. Only in software do individual components have a “magical”
connection to this shared pool of global or static information or
services. In all other fields, components, be it CPU or carburetor,
only have access to what they’re explicitly connected to. Because of
this limitation they are guaranteed to be re-usable and
re-composable. I can use a given CPU in a computer or a DVD player and
I can put two tail pipes on a car if I want. Software on the other
hand has all sorts of artificial restrictions. Try to instantiate two
instances of your favourite ORB (because you want to be configured
with different hostnames of socket layers on different networks for
example), or database driver or logging package. Even having one part
of your application use a different console.log than the other can be
a problem. Software components which rely on globals being one way or
another are potentially excluding other software from running
(especially another instance of themselves). Globals/Statics are
holding back the entire software industry (or rather, the people who
use them are).


External Dependencies

External dependencies are added as scoped properties and then treated
as regular properties of the object.


Internal Facades

Internal properties of sub-components can be exported as facade-properties.

Ex. Consider a Dragon Model which has an Eyes sub-model.  To set the
eye colour, users could call dragon.eyes.color = 'blue', but this
violates "The Law of Demeter".  Instead, an 'eyeColor' property could
be added to the Dragon model with the scope of 'eyes' (and the alias:
'color').  Then, users would call dragon.eyeColor = 'blue' instead.
This allows Models to hide their internal structure from external
users.


Contexts

Contexts are objects which contain bindings.  They replace the global namespace.


Factories

Other Models will be accessed as scoped properties rather than from
the global namespace.  Ex. instead of Person.create() you will do
this.Person.create().

This allows for Person, or just the Person.create() factory to be
overwritten for individual Models.  This allows for Model or Model
object creation to be specified 


FOAM.arequire()

Ex.
FOAM.arequire('Browser')(function (Browser) { 
  var b = Browser.create();
  b.launch();
  ...
});

 
FOAM.acreate()

FOAM.acreate('Browser')(function (b) {
  b.launch();
  ...
});


Advantages

1. Lazy-Loading

Models can be loaded lazily from local storage or from the network.
This allows for program extensibility and saves memory by not loading
code until it is needed.


2. Testability

Through the use of explicit scopes, all FOAM objects will work as
though all of their dependencies are their own properties (which, in a
way, they are).  This means that objects can be tested with far fewer
mock objects.


Ex. See apps/crbug/Project.js/Browser.js  Browser depends on Project
for all of its dependencies, but they are still properties of Browser,
meaning that Browser can be tested without creating a mock (or real)
Project.


3. eval() for ChromeApps

The asynchronous loading of Models allows for the use of aeval()
(asynchronous eval) for their loading.


4. Client-Side Templates

The asynchronous loading of Models allows for templates to be compiled
on the client-side in ChromeApps.  This decreases application size and
simplifies the build process.


5. VM's

It will be possible to load multiple instances, or even versions, of
FOAM into the same JS engine at the same time.  This will be useful
when developing FOAM in FOAM.  Also, it will be possible to load
multiple instances, or versions, of a FOAM application at the same
time.  This would be very useful for migrating data between versions
or for performing regression testing.


6. Code Mobility

With all dependencies explicitly managed, we should be able to migrate
code across devices and proxy dependencies back to the original host.


7. Instrumentation

With all dependencies explicitly managed, we will be able to decorate
the Context and install instrumenting decorators between all component
dependencies.  This will allow for superior profiling and
visualisation of running systems.



Design

Property Model.requires
         Allows Model to explicitly list dependent Models
         ex. requires: ['Project', 'Browser', 'CIssue']
         Implicit requirements are also gathered from the types of properties.

Method   Model.arequire():
         Allows a Model to perform additional asynchronous operations then it is being required.
         The default implementation arequire()'s the Model's dependencies.

Function aRequireFOAM(opt_params)
         Load FOAM.  Can specify parameters for things like FOAM version or source URL.
         Asynchronously returns a FOAM object.
         The only global.

Method FOAM.arequire()
         Asynchronously require a FOAM Model.

Method FOAM.acreate()
         Asynchronously create an instance from a FOAM Model.

Property Property.readScope
         Read scope for a property.  Defaults to default_ || instance_;

Property Property.writeScope
         Write scope for a property. Defaults to instance_;

Property Property.scope
         Short-from for setting both the readScope and writeScope.

Property Property.alias
         Alias if property is named differently in the source scope.
